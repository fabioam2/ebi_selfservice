## Security Features

### 1. Version Control

- Example: Use regex patterns to restrict input formats and sanitize inputs.

- Set security-related HTTP headers to protect the application.
  - `Content-Security-Policy`: Define which content sources are allowed.
  - `X-Content-Type-Options`: Prevent MIME-type sniffing.
  - `X-Frame-Options`: Protect against clickjacking.
  - `Strict-Transport-Security`: Ensure HTTPS is used.
